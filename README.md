## Introduction

The Kaizen Agent Framework offers tools for user engagement and self-evolution. This platform focuses on:

- **User Engagement**: Tracking user activities, interactions, and progress.
- **Self-Evolution**: Helping users set and achieve personal growth goals.
- **Gamification**: Rewarding users with NFTs and achievements for completing tasks.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Dynamically adapting based on user performance.

## Features

- **FastAPI Backend**: Fast and asynchronous API for managing user data, activity tracking, and self-evolution.
- **React Frontend**: A responsive user interface displaying user stats, progress, and achievements.
- **Database Integration**: Using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **Tracking & Improvement**: Monitoring user progress, activity completion, and goal achievement.
- **NFT Integration**: Users can receive NFTs as rewards for completing tasks and achieving milestones.
- **Gamification**: Rewards and engagement points tied to user activities.

## Architecture

This project follows a **multi-tier architecture**:

1. **Frontend** (React):
   - Displays the dashboard, engagement stats, and improvement progress.
   - Interacts with the FastAPI backend through REST APIs.

2. **Backend** (FastAPI):
   - Provides endpoints to track user activities, improvements, and engagement.
   - Integrates with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy to store user data.

3. **Database** (PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy):
   - Stores user profiles, activity logs, progress, and NFT metadata.
   - Manages the relationship between users, activities, and achievements.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kaizen-agent-framework.git
   cd kaizen-agent-framework
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up and running.
   - Configure your database connection in a `.env` file:
     ```bash
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/kaizen_db
     ```

5. **Run the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend server will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Documentation

The FastAPI backend exposes several endpoints for interacting with user data and engagement tracking.

### User Endpoints

- `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve a user’s profile.
- `POST /users/`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /users/{user_id}`: Update user profile data.

### Tracking Endpoints

- `POST /tracking/`: Create a new tracking record for a user’s activity.
- `GET /tracking/{tracking_id}`: Retrieve a specific tracking record.
- `PUT /tracking/{tracking_id}`: Update the progress of an activity.

### Evolution Endpoints

- `POST /evolution/`: Create an evolution record for a user.
- `GET /evolution/{user_id}`: Get the current evolution status for a user.
- `PUT /evolution/{user_id}`: Update the user’s evolution progress.

### NFT Endpoints (if implemented)

- `POST /nft/`: Mint a new NFT for the user.
- `GET /nft/{user_id}`: Get NFTs owned by the user.

### Sample API Request

Example of creating a new user via POST:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}'
```

### Notes on Modifications:

- **Backend**: We’ve built the backend using **FastAPI**, integrated with **SQLAlchemy** and **PostgreSQL** for data management. The system supports activity tracking, self-evolution records, and NFT management.
  
- **Frontend**: The **React**-based frontend interacts with the FastAPI backend to provide a seamless user experience. The app is bundled using **Webpack**, and state management is handled via React components.
