# Kaizen Agent Framework

## Overview
The **Kaizen Agent Framework** is a dynamic system designed to balance user engagement with measurable improvement. It features self-evolving algorithms and tools to foster continuous growth and adaptability. The framework is modular and scalable, making it suitable for various applications, including user engagement, feedback systems, and adaptive AI solutions.

## Features
1. **Backend**
   - FastAPI-based backend for performance and scalability.
   - Endpoints for user engagement tracking, improvement analytics, and self-evolution logic.

2. **Frontend**
   - React-based user interface for data visualization and interaction.
   - Modular components for dashboards, engagement metrics, and improvement stats.

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Engagement prediction models using scikit-learn.
   - Self-evolution algorithms for continuous system adaptation.

4. **Data Handling**
   - Pre-configured sample data for quick setup and testing.
   - Utilities for loading and managing custom datasets.

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend APIs and ML models.
   - Comprehensive testing to ensure system reliability.

6. **Licensing**
   - Open-source, licensed under the MIT License.
